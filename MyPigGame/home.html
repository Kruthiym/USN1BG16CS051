                - The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
                <br>
                - In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he wishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
                <br>
                - BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
                <br>
                - The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
                <br>

                GAME RULES:
                <br>
                - The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
                <br>
                - In each turn, a player rolls 2 die as many times as he wishes. Each result of the sum of the die get added to his ROUND score
                <br>
                - BUT, if the player rolls equal number on each die, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
                <br>
                - The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets subtracted from his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
                <br>
                - The first player to reach exactly 0 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
                <br>
                - Constraints is that if the GLOBAL score is either 1 or 2 then that player loses the game
                <br>
                - Since we do not get a sum of 1 when 2 die are rolled and also the sum of 2 can only be obtained when on
                <br>
                each die there occurs a 1,but this is not possible since it violates the rule.
